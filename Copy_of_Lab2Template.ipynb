        "For my deviation graph, I decided to take a look at the first round of 64 data from the year 2000. More specifically I wanted to know the outcomes of games and the difference in the seed they were ranked at. As we can see from this graph there were only three upsets in the round of 64 and the largest difference in seed was a five seed upset. Predicting who wins and loses these games is always difficult but if we made more and more of these gra[hs for every year we would be able to create a probability that a team with a six seed difference could be upset. These were the trends that I expected to see because rankings are usually accurate but every single year a handful of teams upset another team."

I wanted to be able to answer the question if one team is scoring a lot of points will the other team score a lot of points too? As we can see in the graph there is a positive correlation answering my question. As we can see as most teams concede points they also score more. Also as we can see there are some outliers where teams are losing by 50 points and if we looked closer at that data I would guess that these teams were the first second or third team seeds who should have no problem winning."

This graph is saying that the first seed wins the most and therefore has the most winning points on their record. Additionally, this stayed true with the higher seed having more points with one exception. Seed 6 and 7 are reverse of what we would expect in the data but this shows that it is more likely to see a winning 7th seed put up more points than a winning 6th seed."

Unfortunately, it looks like there was no change over the years in total points scored so I guess I have to continue collecting evidence for my case elsewhere."

As shown last time, this is my second attempt to prove that defense doesn't win championships. The data shows that the 3 lowest values are in the past ten years so maybe I was wrong and in fact teams are getting smarted and keeping the games to a lower amount of points that the past."

As the data shows the Wildcats have the most wins followed up by Blue Devils. This type of graph is perfect for showing lower amounts of data while also having the ability to be very descriptive.

In addition, we could calculate the win percentage each team has in championship games."
