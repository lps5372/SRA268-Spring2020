I wanted to see if there were any trend with the difference in temperature over the course of July in 2017. Without seeing the data I would expect there is no significant change in average difference in temperature. Since the data we are looking at is only over a month is it very unlikely that there will be a change in temperature difference."

Throughout the month of July there was only one day that stuck out for being irregular. on July 7th there was only a temperature difference of 3Â°. Although this stuck out, there are very reasonable situations that could lead to this happening. One of those situations would be if it rained all day the temp would then be held to a lower threshold."
